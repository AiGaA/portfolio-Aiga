        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Aiga and I am passionate about software development, solving problems and
            creating new things. Since I was a little girl, I had a great interest in technology and how it works.
            Although I took a little untraditional path to my programmers journey, I have always enjoyed what
            I am doing and currently am only focusing on becoming a full-time Web Developer.
        </p>
        <p>I have recently completed a Front-end web development course, where I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS 
            and JavaScript. I had great fun on learning CSS and creating new designs. Completing main project of the course was
            great challenge, as maily involved JavaScript, but there I learned actually how much I enjoy to solve problems
            and finidng solutions.
        </p>
        <p>I believe that being a programmer means that there is a constant learning, in such rapidly evolving industry.
            And this is exactly what I enjoy the most and truly believe, I have found my path.
        </p>
